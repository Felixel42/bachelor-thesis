# Bachelor thesis

The objective of my thesis can be briefly described  as: Create a 2.0 version of Project Oaken's [water-meter-acorn](https://github.com/Oaken-Innovations/water-meter-acorn). New features are: 

* Authentication via the Ethereum Blockchain 
* Separate views for admin and customer 
* Hourly recording of smart meter readings and payment history.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
